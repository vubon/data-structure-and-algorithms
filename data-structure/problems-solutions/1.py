A data structure for n elements and O(1) operations
Propose a data structure for the following:
The data structure would hold elements from 0 to n-1. There is no order on the elements
(no ascending/descending order requirement)

The complexity of the operations should be as follows:

* Deletion of an element – O(1)
* Finding an element – O(1)
